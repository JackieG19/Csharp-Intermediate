Access Modifiers

- In C# we have 5 access modifiers: public, private, protected, internal and protected internal.

- A class member declared with public is accessible everywhere.

- A class member declared with private is accessible only from inside the class.

- We’ll learn about the other access modifiers when we get to the inheritance.

- We use access modifiers to hide the implementation details of a class.

So anything that is about “how” a class does its job should be declared as private.

This way, we make sure other parts of the code will not touch the implementation detail of a class.

And as a result we improve the robustness of our code.

If change the implementation of a class, we only need to make changes inside the class.

No other parts of the code will need to be changed.

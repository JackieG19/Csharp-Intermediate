/*
A field can be initialized in two ways:

- In a constructor, or directly upon declaration.

- The benefit of initialising a field during declaration is that if your class has one or
more constructors, youâ€™ll make sure that the field will always be initialised irrespective
of which constructor is going to be called.*/
